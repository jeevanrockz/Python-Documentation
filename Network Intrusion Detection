### 📚 Official Scikit-learn Documentation

1. **Isolation Forest**
   - An ensemble method that isolates anomalies by randomly partitioning data.  
   - Documentation: IsolationForest — Scikit-learn [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fgenerated%2Fsklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html")  
   - Key parameters:
     - `n_estimators`: number of trees.
     - `contamination`: expected proportion of anomalies.
     - `random_state`: reproducibility.

2. **One-Class SVM**
   - Learns a decision boundary around normal data points; anomalies fall outside.  
   - Documentation: OneClassSVM — Scikit-learn [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fgenerated%2Fsklearn.svm.OneClassSVM.html")  
   - Key parameters:
     - `nu`: proportion of anomalies.
     - `kernel`: type of kernel (e.g., RBF).
     - `gamma`: kernel coefficient.

3. **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**
   - Detects anomalies based on local density deviations.  
   - Documentation: LocalOutlierFactor — Scikit-learn [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fgenerated%2Fsklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor.html")  
   - Key parameters:
     - `n_neighbors`: number of neighbors to compare density.
     - `contamination`: expected proportion of anomalies.

### ✅ Why This Documentation Matters
- **Isolation Forest docs** explain how anomalies are isolated via random partitioning.  
- **One-Class SVM docs** show how kernel-based boundaries detect outliers.  
- **LOF docs** highlight density-based anomaly detection.  
- Tutorials provide **real-world context** (fraud detection, intrusion detection, healthcare).
