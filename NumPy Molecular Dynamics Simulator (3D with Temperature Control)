# 📘 Project Title: **NumPy Molecular Dynamics Simulator (3D with Temperature Control)**

## 📖 Overview
This project simulates the motion of particles in a 3D box using Newton’s laws of motion and the Lennard-Jones potential. It employs the Velocity Verlet integration method to update positions and velocities, applies periodic boundary conditions, and uses velocity rescaling to maintain a target temperature. The simulator tracks energies and temperature over time, providing insights into molecular behavior in controlled environments.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
- **System Setup:** Define number of particles, box size, time step, and simulation length.  
- **Force Calculation:** Compute inter-particle forces using the Lennard-Jones potential.  
- **Integration:** Update positions and velocities using Velocity Verlet.  
- **Temperature Control:** Rescale velocities to maintain target temperature.  
- **Simulation Loop:** Run for many steps, storing trajectories and energies.  
- **Visualization:** Plot energy vs time and temperature vs time.

## 🔧 Detailed Workflow

### 1. System Setup
- **Particles:** Randomly placed in a cubic box of side length \(L\).  
- **Velocities:** Initialized with small random values.  
- **Parameters:**  
  - \( \epsilon \): depth of potential well.  
  - \( \sigma \): particle size parameter.  
  - \( dt \): time step.  
  - \( N \): number of particles.  

---

### 2. Lennard-Jones Potential
The potential energy between two particles separated by distance \(r\) is:
\[
V(r) = 4\epsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6 \right]
\]

The force is the negative gradient:
\[
F(r) = 24\epsilon \left[ \frac{2\sigma^{12}}{r^{13}} - \frac{\sigma^6}{r^7} \right] \hat{r}
\]

Periodic boundary conditions ensure particles exiting one side re-enter from the opposite side.

---

### 3. Velocity Verlet Integration
Positions and velocities are updated as:
\[
r(t+dt) = r(t) + v(t)dt + \frac{1}{2}a(t)dt^2
\]
\[
v(t+dt) = v(t) + \frac{1}{2}[a(t) + a(t+dt)]dt
\]

This method conserves energy better than simple Euler integration.

---

### 4. Temperature Control
Temperature is related to average kinetic energy:
\[
T = \frac{2 \langle KE \rangle}{3N}
\]

Velocities are rescaled after each step:
\[
v \rightarrow v \cdot \sqrt{\frac{T_{\text{target}}}{T_{\text{current}}}}
\]

This keeps the system at the desired temperature (canonical ensemble).
