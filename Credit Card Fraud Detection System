# 📄 Credit Card Fraud Detection System (Scikit-learn)

## 1. Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Scikit-learn** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraud detection is a classic **imbalanced classification problem**, where fraudulent cases are rare compared to legitimate ones. The system builds a machine learning model to classify transactions as **legitimate (0)** or **fraudulent (1)**.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Handle **imbalanced datasets** effectively.  
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection.  
- Use **feature preprocessing and scaling** for numerical and categorical data.  
- Simulate **real-time transaction predictions**.  

---

## 3. Dataset
- **Synthetic dataset** generated for demonstration.  
- Features include:
  - Transaction amount  
  - Time of transaction (seconds in a day)  
  - Merchant type (categorical, encoded as integers)  
  - Location (categorical, encoded as integers)  
  - Device type (categorical, encoded as integers)  
- Target variable: `fraud` (binary classification).  
  - 0 = legitimate transaction  
  - 1 = fraudulent transaction  

---

## 4. Workflow

### Step 1: Data Generation
- Created 5,000 synthetic transactions using NumPy.  
- Fraud cases simulated with imbalance (95% legitimate, 5% fraud).  

### Step 2: Preprocessing
- Features separated into `X` (inputs) and `y` (target).  
- **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) used to balance fraud vs legitimate cases.  
- Alternatively, Scikit-learn’s `class_weight="balanced"` can be used if external libraries are not desired.  

### Step 3: Train/Test Split
- 75% training, 25% testing.  
- Stratified sampling ensures balanced representation of fraud cases.  

### Step 4: Model Training
- Features standardized using **StandardScaler**.  
- Model: **Random Forest Classifier** with `class_weight="balanced"`.  
- Trained on resampled dataset.  

### Step 5: Model Evaluation
- Metrics used:
  - **Classification report** (precision, recall, F1-score).  
  - **Confusion matrix** (true positives, false negatives).  
  - **ROC-AUC score** for probability-based evaluation.  
- Cross-validation performed for robustness.  

### Step 6: Real-Time Prediction Simulation
- New transaction data fed into the trained model.  
- Model outputs:
  - **Fraud prediction** (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraud).  
  - **Fraud probability** (confidence score).  

---

## 5. Results
- Random Forest achieved strong performance with balanced precision and recall.  
- ROC-AUC confirmed good separation between fraud and legitimate transactions.  
- Real-time simulation successfully predicted fraud probability for new transaction input.  

---

## 6. Key Learnings
- Fraud detection requires **special handling of imbalanced datasets**.  
- **SMOTE** or `class_weight` are effective strategies to balance classes.  
- **Evaluation metrics** must prioritize recall (catching fraud) while minimizing false positives.  
- Scikit-learn provides a complete workflow for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.  

---

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Integrate **real transaction datasets** (e.g., Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset).  
- Compare multiple models (Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Isolation Forest).  
- Deploy model into a **real-time API** for production use.  
- Add **anomaly detection techniques** for unsupervised fraud detection.
