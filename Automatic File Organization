Automatic File Organizer Documentation
Overview
The Automatic File Organizer is a Python script that organizes files in a user's Downloads folder (or a custom directory) into subdirectories based on file type. It helps keep the Downloads folder tidy by categorizing files such as documents, images, videos, audio, archives, executables, code, and data.

The script supports:

Automatic detection of file categories by extension.

Creation of category folders if they don’t already exist.

Moving files into their respective folders.

Handling duplicate filenames by renaming them.

A dry-run mode to preview changes without modifying files.

Logging of all operations for transparency.

Features
✅ Categorizes files by extension into predefined folders.

✅ Skips hidden files and system directories.

✅ Avoids re-organizing files already in the correct folder.

✅ Handles duplicate filenames gracefully (file_1.pdf, file_2.pdf, etc.).

✅ Provides detailed logs (file_organizer.log).

✅ Supports custom target directories.

✅ Safe dry-run mode for testing.

How It Works
Identify Downloads Folder

By default, it uses the current user’s ~/Downloads directory.

A custom path can be specified via command-line arguments.

Create Category Folders

Ensures that subfolders for each category exist before organizing.

Scan Files

Iterates through files in the target folder.

Skips hidden files and directories.

Determine Category

Matches file extension against predefined categories.

Defaults to Other if no match is found.

Move Files

Moves files into their category folder.

Renames files if duplicates exist.

Logging

Records all actions in file_organizer.log.

Logs moved, skipped, and renamed files.

Usage
Command-Line Arguments
--dry-run  
Preview actions without moving files.

--path <directory>  
Specify a custom directory instead of the default Downloads folder.

Examples
# Organize files in the default Downloads folder
python file_organizer.py

# Preview organization without moving files
python file_organizer.py --dry-run

# Organize files in a custom folder
python file_organizer.py --path "/Users/username/Desktop/TestFolder"
Logging
Logs are written to both console and file_organizer.log.

Example log entries:

Code
2026-02-25 09:00:00 - INFO - Ensured folder exists: /Users/username/Downloads/Documents
2026-02-25 09:00:01 - INFO - Moved: report.pdf -> Documents/report.pdf
2026-02-25 09:00:02 - WARNING - File renamed to avoid conflict: photo.jpg -> photo_1.jpg
Error Handling
If the target folder does not exist, an error is logged.

Files that cannot be moved (due to permission issues or other errors) are skipped and logged.

Extending the Script
Add new categories by updating the FILE_CATEGORIES dictionary.

Customize logging format or output location.

Integrate with task schedulers (e.g., cron jobs, Windows Task Scheduler) for automation.
