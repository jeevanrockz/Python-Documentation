## 🔧 Detailed Workflow

### 1. Array Manipulation
- Arrays are created with `np.arange` and reshaped.  
- Broadcasting allows operations between arrays of different shapes.  

Example:
```python
arr = np.arange(1, 10).reshape(3, 3)
arr + 10  # Broadcasting adds 10 to each element
```

---

### 2. Statistics & Random Numbers
- Generate random samples from a normal distribution.  
- Compute mean and variance with `np.mean` and `np.var`.  
- Visualize distribution with a histogram.  

---

### 3. Linear Algebra
- Solve linear systems using `np.linalg.solve`.  
- Compute eigenvalues/eigenvectors with `np.linalg.eig`.  
- Perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with `np.linalg.svd`.  

Mathematical basis:
\[
Ax = b \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = A^{-1}b
\]

---

### 4. Signal Processing (FFT)
- FFT decomposes signals into frequency components.  
- Useful for analyzing periodic signals.  

Example:
\[
X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-2\pi i kn/N}
\]

Peaks in the FFT spectrum correspond to dominant frequencies.

---

### 5. Monte Carlo Simulation
Estimate π by randomly sampling points in a unit square and checking if they fall inside the unit circle:

\[
\pi \approx 4 \cdot \frac{\text{points inside circle}}{\text{total points}}
\]

### 6. Performance Profiling
- Compare naive Python loops vs. NumPy vectorized operations.  
- Demonstrates why NumPy is faster for large datasets.  

---

### 7. Visualization
- Histograms for random data.  
- FFT spectrum plots for signals.  
- Console output for linear algebra and Monte Carlo results.
