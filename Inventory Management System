Database Setup
Create MySQL database:

sql
CREATE DATABASE inventory_db;
USE inventory_db;
Create products table:

sql
CREATE TABLE products (

    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    stock INT NOT NULL,
    sales INT NOT NULL,
    date DATE NOT NULL
);
Flask Configuration
Update db_config in app.py with your MySQL credentials:

python
db_config = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "your_password",
    "database": "inventory_db"
}
Usage

Use the form to add products.
