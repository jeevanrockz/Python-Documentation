📑 Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline Documentation
1. Overview
This project builds a data processing pipeline to prepare customer information for churn prediction. It integrates multiple data sources (demographics, transactions, support tickets), cleans and normalizes data, engineers features, and exports a dataset ready for machine learning models.

2. Inputs
customers.csv  
Contains customer demographics (ID, name, gender, age, region, join date).

transactions.csv  
Contains purchase history (transaction ID, customer ID, date, amount).

support_tickets.csv  
Contains customer complaints (ticket ID, customer ID, date, issue type).

3. Outputs
churn_ready_dataset.csv  
A cleaned and feature‑engineered dataset with columns:

CustomerID

Gender, Age, Region

TotalSpend, AvgSpend, PurchaseFrequency

Complaints

DaysSinceLastPurchase

Last3MonthsActivity

Churn (binary label: 1 = churn, 0 = active)

4. Dependencies
Pandas (data manipulation)

NumPy (numerical operations)

Scikit-learn (ML model training and evaluation)

Install with:

bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
5. Pipeline Steps
Load data from CSV files.

Clean missing values (fill with median, defaults, or zero).

Normalize categorical features (standardize text values).

Merge datasets into a unified DataFrame.

Engineer features:

TotalSpend

AvgSpend

PurchaseFrequency

Complaints

Create lag variables:

DaysSinceLastPurchase

Last3MonthsActivity

Define churn label (inactive in last 3 months or synthetic churn injection for balance).

Export dataset for ML models.

6. Machine Learning Workflow
Feature encoding: Convert categorical variables (Gender, Region) into numeric codes.

Train/test split: Separate data for training and evaluation.

Model training: Logistic Regression (baseline), Random Forest (advanced).

Evaluation: Classification report (precision, recall, F1, accuracy).

7. Usage Instructions
Run the pipeline:

bash
python pro2.py
Expected output:

Confirmation message: ✅ Customer churn dataset prepared successfully!

Classification report showing model performance.

8. Error Handling
Missing Pandas → Install with pip install pandas.

One-class churn error → Synthetic churn cases are injected automatically.

Stratify split error → Ensure at least 2 samples per class; pipeline balances data if needed.

9. Applications
Telecom: Predicting subscriber cancellations.

Banking: Identifying customers likely to close accounts.

E-commerce: Detecting inactive shoppers.

Subscription services: Reducing cancellations in streaming platforms.

10. Future Enhancements
Add Random Forest/XGBoost models for better accuracy.

Implement feature importance analysis.

Visualize churn risk scores with Matplotlib/Seaborn.

Scale pipeline to 1000+ customers for realistic training.
