## 📚 Official Scikit-learn Documentation

### 1. **Spectral Clustering**
- Spectral clustering applies clustering to a projection of the normalized graph Laplacian.  
- It is particularly useful when clusters are **non-convex** or when traditional methods like k-means fail.  
- Documentation: Spectral Clustering — Scikit-learn API Reference [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fgenerated%2Fsklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering.html")  
- Key parameters:
  - `n_clusters`: number of clusters to form.
  - `affinity`: can be an adjacency matrix for graph-based clustering.
  - `assign_labels`: method used to assign labels (e.g., k-means).

### 2. **Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection)**
- Isolation Forest isolates anomalies instead of profiling normal data points.  
- It works well for **high-dimensional datasets** and is efficient for large samples.  
- Documentation: Novelty and Outlier Detection — Scikit-learn User Guide [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Foutlier_detection.html")  
- Key parameters:
  - `contamination`: proportion of anomalies in the dataset.
  - `random_state`: ensures reproducibility.
  - Output: `-1` for anomalies, `1` for normal points.
