Battery Health Monitor Documentation
Overview
The Battery Health Monitor is a Python utility that tracks a laptop’s battery percentage, charging status, estimated health, and charge cycles. It provides real-time monitoring, historical logging, and health estimation based on usage patterns. The tool is especially useful for users who want to understand battery performance over time and anticipate when a replacement may be needed.

Features
Real-time monitoring: Displays current battery percentage, charging status, and estimated time left.

Health estimation: Calculates battery health based on charge cycles and usage history.

Historical logging: Logs battery data into CSV and JSON files for long-term tracking.

Dashboard view: Provides a full overview with battery bar visualization, health status, and statistics.

Continuous monitoring: Runs in the background, updating logs at user-defined intervals.

Battery history: Displays the last N logged entries for quick review.

Windows battery report: Generates a detailed HTML report using powercfg.

Architecture
The script is organized around the BatteryHealthMonitor class, which encapsulates monitoring, logging, and reporting:

Initialization: Loads historical data from CSV and sets up JSON/CSV files.

Data Collection:

get_battery_info() → Reads current battery status via psutil.

get_battery_report() → Uses WMI and powercfg for detailed Windows reports.

Health Estimation:

calculate_battery_health() → Estimates health based on charge cycles and usage patterns.

Logging & Saving:

log_battery_data() → Appends battery data to CSV.

save_metrics() → Saves metrics and health estimate to JSON.

Display Methods:

display_current_status() → Shows current battery info.

display_health_estimate() → Prints health summary.

display_dashboard() → Full dashboard with visualization and statistics.

show_history() → Displays last N log entries.

Continuous Monitoring:

start_continuous_monitoring() → Runs monitoring loop at set intervals.

Usage
Requirements
Python 3.7+

Libraries: psutil, wmi (Windows only), csv, json

CURRENT STATUS:
  Timestamp: 2026-02-24 11:30:00
  Battery Level: 78.0% [██████████████░░░░░░]
  AC Power: On Battery
  Time Left: 2h 15m

HEALTH ESTIMATE:
  Estimated Health: 82.5%
  Status: Excellent
  Estimated Cycles: ~120
  Recommendation: Battery is in good condition

STATISTICS (from logged data):
  Average Battery: 65.4%
  Max Battery: 100.0%
  Min Battery: 20.0%
  Log Entries: 250

Notes
Works best on Windows, where psutil and wmi provide detailed battery info.

Health estimation is approximate and based on charge cycle patterns, not manufacturer data.

Continuous monitoring can be configured with custom intervals (default: 300 seconds).

Logs are stored in battery_logs.csv and metrics in battery_data.json.

Windows users can generate a detailed HTML report (battery_report.html) for deeper insights.
