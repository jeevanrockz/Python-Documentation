# 📑 City Air Quality & Weather Correlation Analysis Documentation

## 1. Overview
This project analyzes **daily air quality data** (PM2.5, PM10, AQI) alongside **weather data** (temperature, humidity, wind speed) across multiple cities. 
The goal is to uncover correlations between pollution levels and weather conditions, identify city‑level air quality trends, and explore seasonal variations. 
It demonstrates how Pandas can be used for **data merging, grouping, correlation analysis, and exporting results**.

## 2. Inputs
- **air_quality.csv** → Daily air quality readings:
  - `Date` → Measurement date.  
  - `City` → City name.  
  - `PM25`, `PM10` → Pollutant concentrations.  
  - `AQI` → Air Quality Index.  

- **weather.csv** → Daily weather readings:
  - `Date` → Measurement date.  
  - `City` → City name.  
  - `Temperature` → Daily average temperature (°C).  
  - `Humidity` → Relative humidity (%).  
  - `WindSpeed` → Wind speed (km/h).  

---

## 3. Outputs
- **city_aqi_summary.csv** → Average AQI per city.  
- **correlation_matrix.csv** → Correlation values between AQI and weather variables.  
- **seasonal_trends.csv** → Monthly AQI averages across all cities.  
- **Console Output** → Confirmation message of successful analysis.  

---

## 4. Dependencies
- **Pandas** → Data manipulation, merging, correlation analysis.  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (optional) → Visualization of trends.  

Install with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## 5. Process Steps
1. **Load datasets** (`air_quality.csv`, `weather.csv`).  
2. **Clean data**:
   - Convert `Date` columns to `datetime`.  
   - Handle missing values (e.g., fill AQI with median).  
   - Standardize city names.  
3. **Merge datasets** on `Date` and `City`.  
4. **Correlation analysis**:
   - Compute correlation matrix between AQI and weather variables.  
   - Identify strongest correlations (e.g., AQI vs. WindSpeed).  
5. **City-level insights**:
   - Average AQI per city.  
   - Rank cities by air quality.  
6. **Seasonal trends**:
   - Group by month to calculate average AQI.  
7. **Export results** to CSV files.  

---

## 6. Usage Instructions
Run the script:
```bash
python air_quality_analyzer.py
```

Expected output:
- Confirmation message: `✅ Air quality & weather analysis completed successfully!`  
- Exported CSV files (`city_aqi_summary.csv`, `correlation_matrix.csv`, `seasonal_trends.csv`).  

---

## 7. Error Handling
- **Invalid frequency alias** → Ensure correct resampling aliases (`"h"`, `"min"`, `"ME"`).  
- **Missing values** → Fill with median or drop rows.  
- **Merge conflicts** → Ensure city names and dates match across datasets.  

---

## 8. Applications
- **Environmental Monitoring** → Track pollution levels across cities.  
- **Urban Planning** → Identify weather conditions that worsen air quality.  
- **Public Health** → Correlate AQI with conditions affecting respiratory health.  
- **Policy Making** → Support decisions on emission control and sustainability.  

---

## 9. Future Enhancements
- Add **visualizations**:
  - Line chart of AQI trends per city.  
  - Scatter plot of AQI vs. WindSpeed.  
  - Heatmap of correlation matrix.  
- Integrate with **real-time air quality APIs**.  
- Automate **daily/weekly reporting**.  
- Expand to **predictive modeling** (forecast AQI based on weather).
