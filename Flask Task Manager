Flask Task Manager Application
Overview
The Flask Task Manager is a simple to-do list web application built using Flask and Python. It allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks. Tasks are stored in memory for demonstration purposes, making this project ideal for learning Flask fundamentals.

Features
Add tasks via a web form.

Mark tasks as complete with a single click.

Delete tasks when no longer needed.

Dynamic web interface using Flask templates and Jinja2.

Code Explanation
app.py
Imports:

python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
Provides Flask framework and utilities for rendering templates and handling requests.

App Initialization:

python
app = Flask(__name__)
tasks = []
Creates the Flask app and initializes an empty list for storing tasks.

Routes:

/ → Displays all tasks.

/add → Handles adding new tasks via POST form submission.

/complete/<task_id> → Marks a task as completed.

/delete/<task_id> → Deletes a task.

Run Server:

python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
Starts the Flask development server.

index.html
Displays tasks dynamically using Jinja2 templating.

Uses loop.index0 to track task IDs for completion and deletion.

Applies a CSS class (done) to completed tasks for visual distinction.

Example Usage
Start the app:

bash
python app.py
Open browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Add tasks, mark them complete, and delete them interactively.

Limitations
Tasks are stored in memory; they disappear when the server restarts.

No user authentication or persistence.

Next Steps
You can extend the app by:

Adding a SQLite database for persistent storage.

Implementing user login for personalized task lists.

Adding due dates and reminders with email notifications.
