# 📘 Project Title: **NumPy-Based Time-Series Analysis & Forecasting Framework**

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates how to analyze and forecast **time-series data** using **NumPy**. It includes generating synthetic data, applying moving averages, detecting anomalies, building a simple autoregressive forecasting model, evaluating predictions, and visualizing results. The emphasis is on **software engineering practices**: modular design, correctness testing, performance optimization, and visualization.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
1. **Data Generation:** Create synthetic noisy sine wave data.  
2. **Analysis:** Compute moving averages and detect anomalies.  
3. **Forecasting:** Implement a simple autoregressive (AR) model.  
4. **Evaluation:** Measure prediction accuracy with RMSE.  
5. **Visualization:** Plot original data, moving averages, anomalies, and forecasts.  
6. **Testing:** Validate correctness on synthetic datasets.

## 🔧 Detailed Workflow

### 1. Data Generation
Synthetic data is generated as a sine wave with added Gaussian noise:

\[
x_t = \sin(0.1t) + \epsilon_t, \quad \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,0.2)
\]

This simulates real-world noisy signals (e.g., stock prices, sensor readings).

---

### 2. Moving Average
Smooths fluctuations by averaging over a sliding window:

\[
MA_t = \frac{1}{w} \sum_{i=0}^{w-1} x_{t-i}
\]

Implemented with NumPy’s `convolve`.

---

### 3. Anomaly Detection
Detects outliers based on deviation from mean:

\[
\text{Anomaly if } |x_t - \mu| > \text{threshold} \cdot \sigma
\]

Where \(\mu\) is mean and \(\sigma\) is standard deviation.

---

### 4. Forecasting (Autoregressive Model)
Predicts future values based on past \(p\) lagged values:

\[
x_t = \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_i x_{t-i} + \epsilon_t
\]

Coefficients \(\phi_i\) are estimated using least squares (`np.linalg.lstsq`). Forecasts are generated iteratively.

---

### 5. Evaluation
Prediction accuracy is measured with **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):**

\[
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
\]

### 6. Visualization

- Original noisy data.  
- Moving average curve.  
- Anomalies marked with red dots.  
- Forecasted values as dashed line.
