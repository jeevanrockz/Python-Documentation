# 📘 Project Title: **NumPy-Based Supply Chain Optimization Simulator**

## 📖 Overview
This project models a simplified supply chain network consisting of factories, warehouses, and retail stores. Using NumPy arrays, it simulates production, storage, demand, and transportation costs. A greedy allocation algorithm assigns shipments along the cheapest available routes while respecting capacity and demand constraints. The simulator calculates total costs and visualizes allocation patterns and scenario outcomes.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
- **Data Setup:** Define capacities, demands, and transport costs.  
- **Greedy Allocation Algorithm:** Assign shipments from factories to warehouses, then warehouses to stores.  
- **Cost Calculation:** Compute total supply chain cost.  
- **Scenario Simulation:** Run multiple demand scenarios to analyze cost changes.  
- **Visualization:** Use Matplotlib to plot allocation heatmaps and cost-demand relationships.

## 🔧 Detailed Workflow

### 1. Data Setup
- **Factories:** Each has a production capacity (units available).  
- **Warehouses:** Each has a storage capacity (units it can hold).  
- **Stores:** Each has a demand (units required).  
- **Transport Costs:**  
  - Factory → Warehouse cost matrix.  
  - Warehouse → Store cost matrix.  

### 2. Greedy Allocation
- **Factory → Warehouse:**  
  - For each warehouse, choose the cheapest factory route.  
  - Allocate as many units as possible without exceeding factory or warehouse capacity.  
- **Warehouse → Store:**  
  - For each store, choose the cheapest warehouse route.  
  - Allocate units to meet demand without exceeding warehouse supply.  

### 3. Cost Calculation
- Total cost is the sum of:
  \[
  \text{Total Cost} = \sum (\text{Factory→Warehouse units} \times \text{FW cost}) + \sum (\text{Warehouse→Store units} \times \text{WS cost})
  \]

### 4. Scenario Simulation
- Run multiple demand scenarios (e.g., normal, high, low).  
- Recalculate allocations and costs for each scenario.  
- Compare how costs scale with demand.  

### 5. Visualization
- **Heatmap:** Shows warehouse→store allocations.  
- **Line Plot:** Shows total cost vs total demand across scenarios.

## 📊 Example Output
- **Console:**  
  ```
  Factory → Warehouse Allocation:
   [[120   0]
    [  0  80]]
  Warehouse → Store Allocation:
   [[70 50  0]
    [ 0 10 40]]
  Total Cost: 860
  ```
- **Plots:**  
  - Heatmap of warehouse→store allocations (blue intensity = units shipped).  
  - Line plot showing how total cost increases with demand scenarios.

## 🧠 Real-World Applications
- **Logistics:** Optimize supply chains for e-commerce or retail companies.  
- **Manufacturing:** Allocate production across plants and distribution centers.  
- **Transportation:** Minimize costs in shipping networks.  
- **Operations Research:** Practice linear programming and optimization with NumPy.  

---

## 🚀 Extensions
- Replace greedy allocation with **linear programming (simplex method)** for exact optimization.  
- Add **random demand fluctuations** to simulate uncertainty.  
- Introduce **multi-period simulation** (dynamic supply chain over time).  
- Compare strategies (greedy vs optimal).  
- Add **visual dashboards** for interactive analysis.
