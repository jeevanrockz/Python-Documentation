# 📑 Smart City Transportation & Traffic Flow Analysis Documentation

## 1. Overview
This project analyzes **smart city transportation data** across multiple domains: traffic sensors, public transit ridership, ride-sharing trips, and weather conditions. 
The goal is to uncover insights about traffic congestion, commuter behavior, and the impact of weather on mobility. 
It demonstrates how Pandas can be used for **data cleaning, aggregation, merging, correlation analysis, and exporting results**.

## 2. Inputs
- **traffic_sensors.csv** → Hourly vehicle counts from road sensors:
  - `Timestamp` → Date and time of sensor reading.  
  - `SensorID` → Identifier for the traffic sensor.  
  - `VehicleCount` → Number of vehicles detected.  

- **transit_usage.csv** → Daily public transit ridership:
  - `Date` → Day of ridership record.  
  - `Mode` → Transit mode (Bus, Metro).  
  - `Ridership` → Number of passengers.  

- **rideshare.csv** → Ride-sharing trip records:
  - `PickupTime`, `DropoffTime` → Trip start and end times.  
  - `DistanceKm` → Trip distance in kilometers.  
  - `Fare` → Trip fare in currency units.  

- **weather.csv** → Daily weather conditions:
  - `Date` → Day of weather record.  
  - `Temperature` → Average daily temperature (°C).  
  - `Rainfall` → Rainfall (mm).  
  - `WindSpeed` → Wind speed (km/h).  

---

## 3. Outputs
- **traffic_summary.csv** → Daily traffic totals.  
- **transit_summary.csv** → Average ridership by mode.  
- **rideshare_summary.csv** → Average trip distance, fare, and duration.  
- **weather_impact.csv** → Correlation between traffic and weather variables.  
- **Console Output** → Confirmation message of successful analysis.  

---

## 4. Dependencies
- **Pandas** → Data manipulation, grouping, merging, correlation analysis.  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (optional) → Visualization of trends.  

Install with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## 5. Process Steps
1. **Load datasets** (`traffic_sensors.csv`, `transit_usage.csv`, `rideshare.csv`, `weather.csv`).  
2. **Clean data**:
   - Convert timestamps to `datetime`.  
   - Normalize categorical values (e.g., transit modes).  
   - Handle missing values (forward fill for sensors).  
3. **Traffic analysis**:
   - Aggregate hourly vehicle counts into daily totals.  
   - Identify peak traffic hours (optional extension).  
4. **Transit analysis**:
   - Calculate average ridership per mode.  
   - Compare ridership trends across days/months.  
5. **Ride-sharing analysis**:
   - Compute average trip distance, fare, and duration.  
   - Identify peak ride-sharing hours (optional extension).  
6. **Weather impact**:
   - Merge traffic and weather datasets on `Date`.  
   - Compute correlation between traffic volume and weather variables.  
7. **Export results** to CSV files.

## 6. Usage Instructions
Run the script:
```bash
python smart_city_analyzer.py
```

Expected output:
- Confirmation message: `✅ Smart city transportation analysis completed successfully!`  
- Exported CSV files (`traffic_summary.csv`, `transit_summary.csv`, `rideshare_summary.csv`, `weather_impact.csv`).  

---

## 7. Error Handling
- **Date mismatch** → Ensure all `Date` columns are converted to `datetime`.  
- **Missing values** → Use `.ffill()` or `.dropna()` depending on context.  
- **Merge conflicts** → Verify column names and formats before merging.  

---

## 8. Applications
- **City governments** → Optimize traffic flow and transit schedules.  
- **Ride-sharing companies** → Identify demand patterns and pricing strategies.  
- **Urban planners** → Study the impact of weather on mobility.  
- **Data scientists** → Build predictive models for congestion and ridership.  

---

## 9. Future Enhancements
- Add **visualizations**:
  - Line chart of traffic volume over time.  
  - Bar chart of transit ridership by mode.  
  - Scatter plot of rainfall vs. traffic congestion.  
  - Heatmap of ride-sharing demand by hour.  
- Integrate with **real-time IoT sensor feeds**.  
- Automate **daily/weekly reporting**.  
- Extend to **predictive analytics** (forecast traffic and ridership).
