Enhanced App Scanner Documentation
Overview
The Enhanced App Scanner is a Python utility that scans installed applications on a system and flags potentially harmful, suspicious, or unnecessary (bloatware) software. It supports Windows, Linux, and macOS, uses a dynamic threat database, and provides results in both rich console output and exportable reports.

Features
Cross-platform scanning: Works on Windows (registry + Program Files), Linux (dpkg), and macOS (brew).

Dynamic threat database: Loads harmful app definitions from an external JSON file for easy updates.

Hash verification: Computes SHA256 hashes of executables for deeper inspection.

Parallel scanning: Uses multithreading to speed up directory and registry scans.

Rich console output: Displays results in colorful tables using the rich library.

Export formats: Saves reports in JSON and CSV for sharing or integration.

Risk categorization: Flags apps as Critical, High, Medium, or Low risk with descriptions.

Architecture
The script is organized around the AppScanner class, which encapsulates scanning, detection, and reporting:

Initialization: Loads the threat database from JSON.

App Collection:

get_windows_apps() → Reads installed apps from registry.

get_program_files_apps() → Scans Program Files directories.

get_linux_apps() → Lists packages via dpkg.

get_macos_apps() → Lists apps via brew.

Detection:

check_app_safety() → Compares app names against harmful database.

get_file_hash() → Computes SHA256 hashes for executables.

Reporting:

display_results_rich() → Shows results in a rich table.

save_csv_report() → Exports results to CSV.

save_report() → Exports results to JSON.

Usage
Requirements
Python 3.7+

Libraries: rich, hashlib, csv, json

On Linux/macOS: dpkg or brew installed for package listing

Run the Script:-
python app_scanner.py

Export Reports
JSON: app_scan_report.json

CSV: app_scan_report.csv

Notes
Detection is name-based: Apps are flagged if their names match entries in the threat database.

Database updates: Keep the JSON file current to improve detection accuracy.

Hash verification: Can be extended to compare against known malware signature lists.

Cross-platform limitations: Registry scanning works only on Windows; Linux/macOS rely on package managers.
