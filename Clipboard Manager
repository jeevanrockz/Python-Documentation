Clipboard Manager (MySQL Version) Documentation
Overview
The Clipboard Manager is a Python application that continuously monitors the system clipboard, saves copied content into a MySQL database, and provides tools to search, restore, and manage clipboard history. It ensures persistence of clipboard data beyond system restarts and allows advanced querying and statistics.

Features
Clipboard monitoring: Detects new clipboard content and saves it automatically.

Duplicate detection: Uses SHA256 hashing to avoid storing duplicates.

History retrieval: Fetches recent clipboard entries with metadata.

Search functionality: Allows keyword-based search across saved entries.

Restore content: Copies a past entry back into the clipboard.

Data management: Delete individual items or clear the entire history.

Statistics: Provides insights like total items, total size, and most accessed entry.

Database Schema
The script automatically creates the database and table if they don’t exist.

Table: clipboard_history

Column	Type	Description
id	INT (PK)	Auto-increment primary key
content	TEXT	Clipboard content
content_hash	VARCHAR(64)	SHA256 hash for duplicate detection
timestamp	TIMESTAMP	Time when entry was saved
accessed_count	INT	Number of times entry was reused
last_accessed	TIMESTAMP	Last time entry was restored
length	INT	Character length of content
content_type	VARCHAR(20)	Defaults to 'text'
Indexes:

idx_timestamp → speeds up queries by time.

idx_content_hash → ensures fast duplicate detection.

Class: ClipboardManager
Initialization
python
cm = ClipboardManager(user="root", password="your_password", database="clipboard_db")
Connects to MySQL.

Creates database and table if missing.

Methods
monitor_clipboard(interval=1)  
Continuously checks clipboard every interval seconds and saves new content.

save_to_clipboard_history(content)  
Saves content if new; updates usage if duplicate.

get_history(limit=20, offset=0)  
Retrieves recent entries with metadata.

search_history(query, limit=20)  
Searches clipboard entries by keyword.

restore_from_history(item_id)  
Restores a saved entry back into the clipboard.

delete_history_item(item_id)  
Deletes a specific entry.

clear_history()  
Clears all clipboard entries.

get_statistics()  
Returns summary statistics (total items, size, max access count).

Usage Example
python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    cm = ClipboardManager(user="", password="", database="clipboard_db")
    cm.monitor_clipboard(interval=2)
Run the script:

bash
python clipboard_manager.py
Copy some text, and you’ll see:

Code
[14:10:05] Saved to history: Hello World...
Check saved entries in MySQL:

sql
USE clipboard_db;
SELECT * FROM clipboard_history;
Notes
Requires MySQL server running locally or remotely.

Requires Python packages: pyperclip, mysql-connector-python.

On Linux, install xclip or xsel for pyperclip to work.
