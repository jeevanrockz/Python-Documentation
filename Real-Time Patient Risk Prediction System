# 📄 Real-Time Patient Risk Prediction System (Scikit-learn)

## 1. Project Overview
This project simulates a **real-time health monitoring system** using **Scikit-learn**. It predicts whether a patient is at risk of a critical health event based on vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, glucose levels, and respiratory rate.  

The system demonstrates how Scikit-learn can be applied to:
- **Data preprocessing & feature engineering**
- **Model training & evaluation**
- **Pipeline construction**
- **Real-time prediction simulation**

---

## 2. Objectives
- Build a machine learning model that classifies patient states into **safe (0)** or **critical risk (1)**.  
- Engineer features that mimic real-time signals (e.g., rate of change in vitals).  
- Evaluate model performance using robust metrics (classification report, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC).  
- Simulate real-time predictions for new patient data.  

---

## 3. Dataset
- **Synthetic dataset** generated to simulate patient vitals.  
- Features include:
  - Heart rate (bpm)  
  - Blood pressure (mmHg)  
  - Oxygen saturation (%)  
  - Glucose (mg/dL)  
  - Respiratory rate (breaths/min)  
  - Derived features: rate of change in heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.  
- Target variable: `critical_event` (binary classification).

## 4. Workflow

### Step 1: Data Generation
- Synthetic data created using NumPy to simulate 5,000 patient records.  
- Target variable (`critical_event`) assigned with imbalance (80% safe, 20% risk).  

### Step 2: Feature Engineering
- Added **rolling differences** (`diff()`) to capture sudden changes in vitals.  
- These features mimic real-time monitoring signals.  

### Step 3: Train/Test Split
- 75% training, 25% testing.  
- Stratified sampling ensures balanced representation of critical events.  

### Step 4: Pipeline Construction
- **StandardScaler** → normalize features.  
- **PCA** → dimensionality reduction to 5 components.  
- **GradientBoostingClassifier** → ensemble learning for robust predictions.  

### Step 5: Model Training & Evaluation
- Model trained on training set.  
- Evaluated with:
  - **Classification report** (precision, recall, F1-score).  
  - **Confusion matrix** (true positives, false negatives).  
  - **Cross-validation ROC-AUC** for robustness.  

### Step 6: Real-Time Prediction Simulation
- New patient data fed into pipeline.  
- Model outputs:
  - **Risk prediction** (0 = safe, 1 = risk).  
  - **Risk probability** (confidence score).  

---

## 5. Results
- Gradient Boosting achieved strong performance with balanced precision and recall.  
- Cross-validation confirmed stability across folds.  
- Real-time simulation successfully predicted risk probability for new patient input.  

---

## 6. Key Learnings
- **Feature engineering** is critical for time-series health data.  
- **Pipelines** streamline preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and modeling.  
- **Cross-validation** ensures reliability in imbalanced datasets.  
- Scikit-learn provides a powerful toolkit for building **production-ready ML workflows**.  

---

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Integrate **streaming data sources** (Kafka, MQTT).  
- Add **time-series models** (e.g., LSTM via deep learning frameworks).  
- Expand dataset with real-world ICU data (e.g., PhysioNet).  
- Deploy model into a real-time API or dashboard for visualization.
