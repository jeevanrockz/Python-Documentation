## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. Multi-Armed Bandit Problem
- A classic **reinforcement learning** problem where an agent must choose between multiple actions (arms) with unknown reward probabilities.
- Goal: maximize cumulative reward over time.
- Challenge: balance **exploration** (trying new arms) vs **exploitation** (choosing the best-known arm).

### 2. ε-Greedy Strategy
- With probability **ε**, choose a random arm (exploration).
- With probability **1-ε**, choose the arm with the highest estimated reward (exploitation).
- Documentation: Exploration vs Exploitation in Bandits (reinforcement learning overview in Bing) [(bing.com in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dmulti%2Barmed%2Bbandit%2Bepsilon%2Bgreedy%2Bdocumentation")

### 3. Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
- Selects arms based on both estimated reward and uncertainty.
- Formula:  
  \[
  UCB_i = \hat{\mu}_i + \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot \ln t}{n_i}}
  \]
  where \(\hat{\mu}_i\) is the average reward of arm \(i\), \(t\) is the trial number, and \(n_i\) is the number of times arm \(i\) has been played.

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- **Cumulative Reward**: total reward collected over trials.
- **Regret**: difference between optimal reward and achieved reward.
- **Convergence**: how quickly the algorithm identifies the best arm.

## 🔧 What You’ll Learn
- How to **simulate environments** for reinforcement learning.  
- Implement **exploration vs exploitation strategies** (ε-greedy, UCB).  
- Evaluate algorithms using **cumulative reward and regret**.  
- Real-world applications: **online advertising, clinical trials, recommendation systems**.  
Would you like me to **add Thompson Sampling (Bayesian approach)** into the code so you can compare it against ε-greedy and UCB in your simulation?
