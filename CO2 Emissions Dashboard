Flask CO₂ Emissions Dashboard
Overview
The Flask CO₂ Emissions Dashboard is a lightweight web application that visualizes emission data from a CSV file. It leverages Flask for backend processing, Jinja2 for templating, and Chart.js for rendering interactive charts. The project demonstrates how to transform raw tabular data into meaningful visual insights.

Features
Reads emission data from a CSV file.

Displays a bar chart of emissions by country for a selected year.

Handles missing or invalid values gracefully.

Provides responsive and interactive visualization with labeled axes and titles.

├── app.py                # Main Flask application

Workflow
Data ingestion: The app reads the CSV file using Python’s csv.DictReader.

Preprocessing: Missing values are replaced with safe defaults ("" for countries, 0 for emissions).

Template rendering: Clean lists of countries and emissions are passed to the Jinja2 template.

Visualization: Chart.js renders the data as a bar chart in the browser.

Usage
Place your dataset (Emissions.csv) in the project folder.

Run the application:

bash
python app.py
Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Interact with the dashboard to view emissions data.

Limitations
Currently visualizes only one year (1997).

No filtering or dynamic year selection.

Data is static and requires CSV updates for new values.

Future Enhancements
Add multiple years as datasets for comparison.

Implement file upload to allow users to load their own CSVs.

Integrate a database (SQLite/MySQL) for persistent storage.

Add filters and dropdowns for interactive exploration.
