# 📑 Hospital Patient Records Analysis Documentation

## 1. Overview
This project analyzes **hospital patient records** across multiple datasets (patients, admissions, treatments, billing) to generate insights about patient care, hospital efficiency, and financial performance. It demonstrates how Pandas can be used to merge related datasets, perform time‑based calculations, and compute healthcare metrics.

---

## 2. Inputs
- **patients.csv** → Patient demographics:
  - `PatientID` → Unique identifier.  
  - `Name`, `Age`, `Gender`, `City`.  

- **admissions.csv** → Admission records:
  - `AdmissionID` → Unique admission identifier.  
  - `PatientID` → Links to patients.  
  - `AdmissionDate`, `DischargeDate`.  
  - `Department` → Hospital department.  

- **treatments.csv** → Treatment records:
  - `TreatmentID` → Unique treatment identifier.  
  - `AdmissionID` → Links to admissions.  
  - `Procedure` → Medical procedure performed.  
  - `Cost` → Cost of treatment.  

- **billing.csv** → Billing records:
  - `BillID` → Unique billing identifier.  
  - `AdmissionID` → Links to admissions.  
  - `AmountPaid` → Payment amount.  
  - `PaymentDate` → Date of payment.  

---

## 3. Outputs
- **patient_summary.csv** → Admission-level stats:
  - Length of stay.  
  - Treatment cost.  
  - Amount paid.  
  - Outstanding balance.  

- **department_performance.csv** → Department-level metrics:
  - Average length of stay.  
  - Total revenue.  

- **billing_summary.csv** → Billing efficiency:
  - Total paid per admission.  
  - Payment delays.  

- **Console Output** → Readmission rate across patients.  

---

## 4. Dependencies
- **Pandas** → Data manipulation, merging, aggregation.  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (optional) → Visualization.  

Install with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## 5. Process Steps
1. **Load datasets** into Pandas DataFrames.  
2. **Clean data**:
   - Convert date columns to `datetime`.  
   - Handle missing discharge dates (patients still admitted).  
   - Normalize department names.  
3. **Patient analysis**:
   - Calculate length of stay.  
   - Average stay per department.  
   - Identify multiple admissions per patient.  
4. **Treatment analysis**:
   - Compute total treatment cost per admission.  
   - Identify most common procedures.  
   - Average treatment cost per department.  
5. **Billing analysis**:
   - Compare billed vs. paid amounts.  
   - Calculate outstanding balances.  
   - Measure payment delays.  
6. **Hospital performance**:
   - Revenue per department.  
   - Readmission rate (admissions within 30 days).  
7. **Export results** to CSV files.

## 6. Usage Instructions
Run the script:
```bash
python hospital_analyzer.py
```

Expected output:
- Confirmation message: `✅ Hospital analytics completed successfully!`  
- Exported CSV files (`patient_summary.csv`, `department_performance.csv`, `billing_summary.csv`).  
- Console output showing readmission rate.  

---

## 7. Error Handling
- **Invalid dates** → Ensure date columns are properly formatted.  
- **Missing values** → Fill or drop depending on context (e.g., unpaid bills).  
- **Merge conflicts** → Check that IDs match across datasets.  

---

## 8. Applications
- **Hospital Management** → Track patient stays, readmissions, and department efficiency.  
- **Financial Analysis** → Monitor billing performance and outstanding balances.  
- **Healthcare Quality** → Measure treatment costs and patient outcomes.  
- **Policy Planning** → Identify trends in admissions and resource allocation.  

---

## 9. Future Enhancements
- Add **visualizations** (bar chart of revenue per department, histogram of length of stay).  
- Integrate with **real-time hospital systems**.  
- Automate **weekly/monthly reporting**.  
- Expand to **predictive analytics** (forecast admissions, costs, readmissions).
