# 📘 Project Title: **NumPy-Based Image Processing Toolkit**

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform basic image processing operations using **NumPy arrays**. 
Images are represented as matrices of pixel values, and operations such as filtering, edge detection, and transformations 
are implemented manually with NumPy rather than relying on specialized libraries like OpenCV. 
The toolkit emphasizes **software engineering practices**: modular design, correctness testing, performance optimization, and visualization.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
1. **Image Representation:** Load images into NumPy arrays, optionally convert to grayscale.  
2. **Filtering:** Implement convolution filters (blur, sharpen, edge detection).  
3. **Transformations:** Rotate, flip, and scale images using NumPy indexing.  
4. **Edge Detection:** Implement Sobel operator for detecting edges.  
5. **Visualization:** Display original and processed images with Matplotlib.  
6. **Testing:** Validate filters and transformations on synthetic or real images.

## 🔧 Detailed Workflow

### 1. Image Representation
- Images are loaded using **PIL (Python Imaging Library)** and converted to NumPy arrays.  
- Grayscale conversion simplifies processing by reducing RGB channels to a single intensity channel.  

```python
def load_image(path, grayscale=False):
    img = Image.open(path)
    if grayscale:
        img = img.convert("L")
    return np.array(img, dtype=float)
```

---

### 2. Convolution Filters
Convolution applies a kernel (small matrix) to each pixel neighborhood to produce effects like blurring or sharpening.

\[
output[i,j] = \sum_{m,n} kernel[m,n] \cdot region[i+m,j+n]
\]

Examples:
- **Blur Kernel:** Averages neighboring pixels.  
- **Sharpen Kernel:** Enhances edges.  
- **Sobel Kernels:** Detect horizontal and vertical edges.  

---

### 3. Transformations
- **Rotation:** Rotate image by 90° using `np.rot90`.  
- **Flip:** Flip vertically using `np.flipud`.  
- **Scale:** Downsample by skipping pixels with slicing.  

---

### 4. Edge Detection
The Sobel operator detects edges by combining horizontal and vertical gradients:

\[
edges = \sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2}
\]

Where \(G_x\) and \(G_y\) are results of convolution with Sobel kernels.

### 5. Visualization
Matplotlib is used to display original and processed images side by side:

```python
def show_images(original, processed, title="Processed Image"):
    plt.subplot(1,2,1)
    plt.imshow(original, cmap="gray")
    plt.title("Original")
    plt.axis("off")

    plt.subplot(1,2,2)
    plt.imshow(processed, cmap="gray")
    plt.title(title)
    plt.axis("off")
    plt.show()
```

---

## 📊 Example Output
- **Blurred Image:** Smooths details.  
- **Sharpened Image:** Enhances edges.  
- **Edge Detection:** Highlights boundaries.  
- **Rotated/Flipped/Scaled Images:** Demonstrates transformations.  

---

## 🧠 Real-World Applications
- **Computer Vision:** Preprocessing images for machine learning.  
- **Medical Imaging:** Enhancing scans for analysis.  
- **Photography:** Applying filters and transformations.  
- **Robotics:** Edge detection for navigation.  

---

## 🚀 Extensions
- Add **color image support** (process RGB channels separately).  
- Implement **histogram equalization** for contrast enhancement.  
- Add **Gaussian blur** and other advanced filters.  
- Handle large images efficiently with vectorized NumPy operations.
