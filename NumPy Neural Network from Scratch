# 📘 Project Title: **NumPy Neural Network from Scratch**

## 📖 Overview
This project implements a feedforward neural network entirely with NumPy, without using external deep learning libraries. 
It demonstrates the mechanics of forward propagation, backpropagation, gradient descent, and training loops. 
The network is trained on synthetic data for binary classification, but the framework can be extended to real-world datasets.

## 🔧 Detailed Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
- Synthetic dataset: 2D points sampled from a normal distribution.  
- Labels: Binary classification based on whether the product of coordinates is positive.  
- One-hot encoding: Converts labels into vectors for training.  

### 2. Network Architecture
- Input layer: 2 features.  
- Hidden layer: 16 neurons, ReLU activation.  
- Output layer: 2 neurons, Softmax activation.  

### 3. Forward Propagation
- Hidden layer:
  \[
  z_1 = XW_1 + b_1, \quad a_1 = \text{ReLU}(z_1)
  \]
- Output layer:
  \[
  z_2 = a_1W_2 + b_2, \quad a_2 = \text{Softmax}(z_2)
  \]

### 4. Loss Function
- Cross-entropy loss:
  \[
  L = -\frac{1}{m}\sum y \cdot \log(\hat{y})
  \]

### 5. Backpropagation
- Output gradients:
  \[
  dZ_2 = a_2 - y
  \]
- Hidden gradients:
  \[
  dZ_1 = (dZ_2 W_2^T) \cdot \text{ReLU}'(z_1)
  \]
- Weight updates:
  \[
  W = W - \eta \cdot dW, \quad b = b - \eta \cdot db
  \]

### 6. Training Loop
- Iterates over epochs.  
- Performs forward pass, computes loss, backpropagates gradients, updates parameters.  
- Tracks loss and accuracy.  

### 7. Visualization
- Loss vs epochs: Shows convergence.  
- Accuracy vs epochs: Shows performance improvement.
