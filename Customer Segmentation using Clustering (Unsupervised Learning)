### 📚 Official Scikit-learn Documentation

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that projects data into fewer dimensions while preserving variance.  
   - Documentation: Scikit-learn PCA [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fgenerated%2Fsklearn.decomposition.PCA.html")  
   - Key parameters:
     - `n_components`: number of dimensions to reduce to.
     - `random_state`: reproducibility.
   - Useful for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.

2. **Clustering Algorithms**
   - Scikit-learn provides multiple clustering methods, including **KMeans**, **DBSCAN**, **Agglomerative Clustering**, etc.  
   - Documentation: Scikit-learn Clustering [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fclustering.html")  
   - For KMeans:
     - `n_clusters`: number of clusters.
     - `init`: initialization method (default `"k-means++"`).
     - `random_state`: reproducibility.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.  
   - Documentation: Silhouette Coefficient [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fclustering.html%23silhouette-coefficient")  
   - Range: -1 (poor clustering) to +1 (dense, well-separated clusters).

4. **Preprocessing**
   - `StandardScaler`: Standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.  
   - Documentation: StandardScaler [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fgenerated%2Fsklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html")
