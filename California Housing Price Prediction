### 📚 Official Scikit-learn Documentation

1. **California Housing Dataset (`fetch_california_housing`)**
   - This dataset is built into Scikit-learn and is designed for regression tasks.  
   - Contains **20,640 samples** with **8 numerical features** (median income, house age, average rooms, population, latitude, longitude, etc.) and the target variable `MedHouseVal` (median house value).  
   - Documentation: fetch_california_housing — Scikit-learn API Reference [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fgenerated%2Fsklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html")  

2. **Regression Models**
   - **Linear Regression**: Basic regression model for continuous targets.  
     Docs: LinearRegression — Scikit-learn [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fgenerated%2Fsklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html")  
   - **Random Forest Regressor**: Ensemble method using decision trees.  
     Docs: RandomForestRegressor — Scikit-learn [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fgenerated%2Fsklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html")  
   - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: Boosting method for strong predictive performance.  
     Docs: GradientBoostingRegressor — Scikit-learn [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fgenerated%2Fsklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html")

3. **Preprocessing**
   - **StandardScaler**: Standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.  
     Docs: StandardScaler — Scikit-learn [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fgenerated%2Fsklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html")  
   - **PolynomialFeatures**: Generates polynomial and interaction features to capture non-linear relationships.  
     Docs: PolynomialFeatures — Scikit-learn [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fgenerated%2Fsklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html")

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **R² score** are standard regression metrics.  
   - Docs: Regression Metrics — Scikit-learn [(scikit-learn.org in Bing)](https://www.bing.com/search?q="https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2Fstable%2Fmodules%2Fmodel_evaluation.html%23regression-metrics")
