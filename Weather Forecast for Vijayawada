📄 Documentation: Flask Weather Dashboard
Overview
The Flask Weather Dashboard is a web application that fetches live weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a browser. It uses Flask for backend logic, Jinja2 for templating, and Chart.js for visualization. The app shows temperature trends for the next several hours in a line chart.

Features
Fetches real-time weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap.

Extracts temperature and time slots for the next 24 hours.

Displays the data in a responsive line chart.

Provides a quick visual overview of temperature changes throughout the day.

Workflow
API request: Flask sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap forecast endpoint.

Data extraction: The JSON response is parsed to get temperature values and timestamps.

Error handling: If the API key is invalid or the city is not found, the app shows an error message instead of crashing.

Template rendering: Clean lists of temperatures and times are passed to the Jinja2 template.

Visualization: Chart.js renders a line chart showing temperature trends.

Usage
Get a free API key from OpenWeatherMap signup page.

Replace "your_openweathermap_api_key" in app.py with your actual key.

Update the CITY variable to the location you want to track.

Run the application:

bash
python app.py
Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

View the line chart showing temperature trends for the next several hours.

Customization
Change city: Modify the CITY variable in app.py.

Adjust forecast range: Change the slice [:8] to include more or fewer time slots.

Style chart: Update Chart.js options for colors, labels, or chart type.

Limitations
Requires a valid OpenWeatherMap API key.

Free API plan has request limits.

Only shows forecast data, not historical weather.

Future Enhancements
Add multiple cities for comparison.

Show additional weather metrics (humidity, wind speed).

Add dropdowns for user-selected cities.

Integrate geolocation to auto-detect the user’s location.
