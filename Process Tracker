Process Resource Tracker Documentation
Overview
The Process Resource Tracker is a Python utility that continuously monitors CPU and memory usage of specific processes. It alerts users when thresholds are exceeded, logs resource usage data, and provides system-wide overviews. This tool is useful for developers, system administrators, and power users who want to track resource-heavy applications and optimize system performance.

Features
Process monitoring: Track CPU and memory usage of selected processes in real time.

Threshold alerts: Generate alerts when CPU or memory usage exceeds defined limits.

Sound notifications: Optional audible alerts when thresholds are breached.

Logging: Save resource usage data to CSV and alerts to JSON for historical analysis.

System overview: Display CPU, memory, and disk usage for the entire system.

Process listing: Show all running processes sorted by CPU usage.

Configuration management: View current monitoring setup including thresholds.

Monitoring summary: Save a summary report after monitoring ends.

Architecture
The script is organized around the ProcessResourceTracker class, which encapsulates monitoring, alerting, and reporting:

Initialization: Sets up log files and monitored process dictionary.

Process Management:

find_processes_by_name() → Finds processes by name.

add_process_to_monitor() → Adds processes to monitoring with thresholds.

Resource Tracking:

get_process_resources() → Retrieves CPU and memory usage for a process.

check_thresholds() → Compares usage against thresholds and generates alerts.

Alerts & Notifications:

sound_alert() → Produces audible alerts.

log_alert() → Saves alerts to JSON.

Logging:

log_resource_data() → Logs usage data to CSV.

save_summary() → Saves monitoring summary to JSON.

Display Methods:

display_process_details() → Shows detailed resource usage with visual bars.

display_system_overview() → Displays system-wide CPU, memory, and disk usage.

show_all_processes() → Lists all running processes.

show_configuration() → Displays monitoring configuration.

Continuous Monitoring:

start_monitoring() → Runs monitoring loop with periodic updates.

Usage
Requirements
Python 3.7+

Library: psutil

Run the Script:-

Notes
Thresholds: Default CPU and memory thresholds are 80%.

Alerts: Alerts are logged once per minute per process to avoid spamming.

Cross-platform: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Logs:

Resource usage → process_logs.csv

Alerts → process_alerts.json

Monitoring summary → monitoring_summary.json
