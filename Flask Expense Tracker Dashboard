Workflow
CSV Upload: User uploads a CSV file with columns Category, Amount, Date.

Database Storage: Flask inserts the data into the MySQL expenses table.

Data Query: Flask queries aggregated data (sum by category, sum by date).

Template Rendering: Data is passed to the Jinja2 template.

Visualization: Chart.js renders a pie chart and line chart in the browser.

Setup Instructions
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install flask mysql-connector-python
Create MySQL database and table:

sql
CREATE DATABASE expenses_db;
USE expenses_db;

CREATE TABLE expenses (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    category VARCHAR(255),
    amount FLOAT,
    date DATE
);
Update credentials in app.py:

python
db_config = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "root",          # your MySQL username
    "password": "password",  # your MySQL password
    "database": "expenses_db"
