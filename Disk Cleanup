📖 Disk Cleanup Utility Documentation
Overview
The Disk Cleanup Utility is a Python tool that scans directories to identify large files, duplicate files, and unused temporary files. It provides safe cleanup recommendations, detailed analysis, and optional deletion functionality. This utility helps users reclaim disk space and maintain system efficiency.

Features
Large file detection: Finds files larger than a user-defined threshold (default: 100 MB).

Duplicate file detection: Identifies duplicate files using size and MD5 hash comparison.

Temporary file detection: Scans common temp/cache directories for unused files older than a specified age.

Cleanup recommendations: Provides categorized suggestions (safe deletions, recommended deletions, manual review).

Reporting: Saves analysis results to JSON for record-keeping.

Dry-run deletion: Shows what would be deleted without actually removing files.

Cross-platform support: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS with platform-specific temp locations.

Architecture
The script is organized around the DiskCleanupUtility class, which encapsulates scanning, analysis, and cleanup:

Initialization: Sets root path (default: user home directory).

Scanning Methods:

scan_large_files() → Finds large files above a threshold.

scan_duplicate_files() → Detects duplicates by size or hash.

scan_temporary_files() → Identifies old temp/cache files.

Display Methods:

display_large_files() → Shows top large files.

display_duplicate_files() → Displays duplicate groups and potential savings.

display_temporary_files() → Lists temp files with age and size.

display_cleanup_recommendations() → Summarizes findings and provides recommendations.

Reporting & Cleanup:

save_report() → Saves analysis results to JSON.

cleanup_confirmed() → Deletes files (or simulates deletion in dry-run mode).

Usage
Requirements
Python 3.7+

Standard libraries (os, sys, hashlib, json, pathlib, datetime)

DISK SPACE ANALYSIS:
  Large files (>100MB): 12.5 GB
  Duplicate files: 4.2 GB
  Temporary files: 3.8 GB
  Total potential savings: 8.0 GB

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. 🔵 DELETE TEMPORARY FILES (Safe)
   Potential savings: 3.8 GB
   Files: 120
   Risk: Very Low - These are cache/temp files
   Action: Safe to delete immediately

2. 🟡 DELETE DUPLICATE FILES (Recommended)
   Potential savings: 4.2 GB
   Duplicate groups: 15
   Risk: Medium - Keep one copy of each file
   Action: Review before deleting

3. 🟠 REVIEW LARGE FILES (Manual Review)
   Files larger than 100MB: 30
   Risk: High - These may be important
   Action: Manually review and delete if unnecessary
Notes
Large files: Useful for identifying media, backups, or unused installers.

Duplicate detection: Hash-based comparison ensures accuracy but may be slower.

Temporary files: Safe to delete, but the utility recommends reviewing duplicates and large files manually.

Dry-run mode: Prevents accidental deletion by showing what would be removed before execution.

Reports: Saved in disk_cleanup_report.json for later review.
