CSV to Dictionary Script
Overview
This Python script reads data from a CSV file and stores it in a dictionary. Each column header in the CSV becomes a key, and the values under that column are stored as a list. This structure makes it easy to perform data analysis and transformations later.

Features
Reads any CSV file with headers.

Automatically maps each header to a list of values.

Handles multiple rows and columns efficiently.

Uses only Python’s built-in csv module (no external libraries like pandas).

Code Explanation
Importing the CSV module

python
import csv
The built-in csv module is used to parse CSV files.

Function Definition

python
def read_csv_to_dict(filename):
    data_dict = {}
    with open(filename, mode='r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        headers = next(reader)  # First row is header
Opens the file in read mode.

Reads the first row as headers.

Initializes an empty dictionary.

Initialize Dictionary Keys

python
        for header in headers:
            data_dict[header] = []
Each header becomes a dictionary key with an empty list.

Populate Dictionary with Values

python
        for row in reader:
            for i, value in enumerate(row):
                data_dict[headers[i]].append(value)
Iterates through each row and appends values to the corresponding header list.

Return Dictionary

python
    return data_dict
Example Usage

python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    filename = r"C:\Users\jeeva\OneDrive\Desktop\Emissions.csv"
    result = read_csv_to_dict(filename)
    print("Dictionary created from CSV:\n")
    for key, values in result.items():
        print(f"{key}: {values}")
Defines the file path.

Calls the function.

Prints the dictionary in a readable format.

Example Output
If the CSV file contains:

Code
Name,Age,Department
Alice,30,HR
Bob,25,IT
Charlie,28,Finance
The script produces:

python
{
  "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
  "Age": ["30", "25", "28"],
  "Department": ["HR", "IT", "Finance"]
}
Limitations
All values are stored as strings. Numeric values must be converted to int or float for analysis.

Assumes the first row contains headers.

Next Steps
You can extend this script to:

Convert values to floats.

Filter rows based on conditions.

Export dictionary back to CSV.
